# argparse

A minimal implementation of argparse for python <= 2.2

## Why

I recenlty got involved in a legacy project using an old version of Jython.

I found out that:

- optparse was introduced in python 2.3 and deprecated in python 3.2
- argparse was introduced in python 3.2

This module provides the familiar [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) mechanism to build CLIs on older environments.
